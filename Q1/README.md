# **License Plate Damage Detection (Q1)**

This program checks front and rear license plate labels to determine whether a vehicle‚Äôs license plate is BROKEN/DAMAGED or OK, based on YOLO output files.

# **üîé How It Works** 

Each vehicle has a front and rear YOLO .txt label file.

The program looks for a specific YOLO class ID (BROKEN_CLASS_ID) that indicates a damaged plate.

Status is evaluated as follows:

Front Status ‚Üí from the front label file

Rear Status ‚Üí from the rear label file

Overall Status ‚Üí BROKEN if either side is broken, otherwise OK

Results are printed in the console and also saved in a CSV file (license_plate_status.csv).

# **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration** 

At the top of the script, update the following as needed:

FRONT_DIR = Path(r"C:\...\Q1\Broken\Front")   # Folder with front labels
REAR_DIR  = Path(r"C:\...\Q1\Broken\Rear")    # Folder with rear labels
BROKEN_CLASS_ID = 1                           # YOLO class ID for "broken plate"

# **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage** 

Place YOLO .txt label files for front and rear plates in their respective folders:

Q1/Broken/Front/car1.txt
Q1/Broken/Rear/car1.txt


# Run the script: 

python broken_plate_check.py


# The program will:

Match vehicles with both front and rear labels.

Check each label for BROKEN_CLASS_ID.

Print results to the console.

Save results in license_plate_status.csv.

# **üìä Example Output** 
Found 12 paired cars.

=== License Plate Status ===
Car        Front      Rear       Overall   
----------------------------------------
car1       BROKEN     OK         BROKEN
car2       OK         BROKEN     BROKEN
car3       BROKEN     BROKEN     BROKEN
...
car12      OK         OK         OK


CSV (license_plate_status.csv):

car,front_status,rear_status,overall_status
